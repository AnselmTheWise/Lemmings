Instructions:
Your mission here consists on leading all the little lemmings to a way out.
In order to do that, you must examine the world around them, and,
by selecting and one power of the ones available in the bar below
and one of the lemmings, order them to do things like: climbing, digging,
or stopping each other.
If you give up, you can always click the explosion button to start again.
If you get bored, speed up using the appropiate button.
If you get stressed, pause the game with the button, too.
Next, you have a brief description of the different abilities you can give
to a lemming:
- Blocker: blocks the way for other lemmings
- Digger: digs a vertical tunnel
- Basher: digs a horizontal tunnel
- Climber: climbs up walls
- Builder: builds a diagonal bridge for a certain amount of time
- Portal placer: places a portal rigth when told to do so. That portal will be connected to the next or previous
 selected portal (a maximum of two per level can be placed).
